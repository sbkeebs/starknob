### about these files

the knob is available as STEP or stl, and if you need another format, reach out and i'll see what i can do.

there are 3 types of decorations:
- debossed = the star is an empty shape 0.5mm deep on the top of the knob
- inset = the star is a separate piece (or it should be) set into the top of the knob (it will not show unless the star is printed in a separate color)
- starless = just a flat top

### starknob
a knob I designed for rotary encoders with knurled shafts. This is offered as-is, CC0, feel free to produce, copy, or modify it.

its main design goal was to be easy to turn with a single finger, and serves as a scroll knob on at least one of my keyboards. other goals were to be as low-profile as possible, and to fit in the space of a single keycap (18-19mm square).

design was done in onshape, and is publicly available at https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fed26ee9d9ae09ff519f7d6e/w/d37ee2cc153cceb1dad341f8/e/49971c6af7563e473750c349
